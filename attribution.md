This project is derived from [lrndis](https://github.com/fetisov/lrndis), which also utilizes code from [usbstick](https://colinoflynn.com/tag/usb/).

The USB stack is from the HAL driver provided by [ST](https://www.st.com/).

The network stack is powered by [lwIP](https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/lwip/).

The toaster.svg image used in the web interface was obtained from [isometric-toaster](https://openclipart.org/detail/20971/isometric-toaster-by-rg1024).  The file was put on a diet by removing the metadata, reducing the file size from 17374 to 12174 bytes (very important when flash size is limited).
